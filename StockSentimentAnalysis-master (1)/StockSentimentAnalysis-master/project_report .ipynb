    "In this project, we try use financial news to predict stock fluctuation. We believe that financial news articles posted in popular financial journals like WSJ, Financial Times, Bloomberg, etc. have a direct correlation to change in a given company’s stock. The correlation boils down to positive articles about a company leading to rise in stock prices whereas negative articles have an adverse effect on the stock price. \n",
